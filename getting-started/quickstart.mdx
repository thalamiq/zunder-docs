This guide gets you running **Zunder** locally.

## Docker

The simplest way to get started is to use Docker. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

You can download the latest release bundle and run it with the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.yourfhir.dev | sh
```

This will create a directory called `zunder` in your current working directory.

When it finishes, three containers will be running:

- `zunder-db`: The PostgreSQL database exposed on port 5432
- `zunder-server`: The FHIR API exposed on port 8080 (background workers run embedded in the same process)
- `zunder-ui`: The Admin UI exposed on port 3000

You can access the Admin UI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can access the FHIR API at [http://localhost:8080/fhir](http://localhost:8080/fhir).

## Working with FHIR Resources

Zunder supports all standard FHIR REST operations. Let's start by creating a patient.

### Create a Resource

Create a new [Patient](https://hl7.org/fhir/patient.html) resource with a known ID using PUT:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient/example-patient \
  -H "Content-Type: application/fhir+json" \
  -d '{
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "id": "example-patient",
    "name": [{"family": "Smith", "given": ["John"]}],
    "gender": "male",
    "birthDate": "1974-12-25"
  }'
```

The server will create the resource and return it with version and metadata:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "example-patient",
  "name": [{ "family": "Smith", "given": ["John"] }],
  "gender": "male",
  "birthDate": "1974-12-25",
  "meta": {
    "versionId": "1",
    "lastUpdated": "2026-01-11T18:15:25.865119+00:00"
  }
}
```

### Read a Resource

Retrieve the patient you just created:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient/example-patient
```

### Search for Resources

Search for all patients in the system:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient
```

This returns a [FHIR Bundle](https://hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html) containing matching resources. You can also use search parameters:

```bash
# Search by family name
curl http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient?family=Smith

# Search by birthdate
curl http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient?birthdate=1974-12-25
```

### Update a Resource

Update the patient by adding contact information:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient/example-patient \
  -H "Content-Type: application/fhir+json" \
  -d '{
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "id": "example-patient",
    "name": [{"family": "Smith", "given": ["John", "William"]}],
    "gender": "male",
    "birthDate": "1974-12-25",
    "telecom": [{
      "system": "email",
      "value": "john.smith@example.com"
    }]
  }'
```

The server will return the updated resource with an incremented version number (`versionId: "2"`).

### Delete a Resource

Delete the patient resource:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient/example-patient
```

The server returns a `204 No Content` response on successful deletion.

## Configuration

You can configure the FHIR Server by editing the `config.yaml` file in the `zunder` directory.

See the [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration) page for more details.

## Next steps

Continue with [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration) to customize the server for your environment.
