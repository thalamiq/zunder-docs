**Ferrum** is a [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/) R4/R5 ecosystem built in Rust. At its core is a high performance REST server for healthcare interoperability: CRUD, search, batch and transaction bundles, terminology services, and more. The monorepo also includes a validator, FHIRPath engine, snapshot generator, CLI tools, and Admin UI.

<Info>
  Ferrum is under active development. If you encounter issues or spec
  inconsistencies, please report them on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/thalamiq/ferrum/issues).

## Why Ferrum?

- **High performance**: Written in Rust with PostgreSQL; optimized for low latency and high throughput
- **Extensible**: FHIR packages, custom OperationDefinitions, and SMART on FHIR authentication
