title: 'Delete Resource'
description: 'Remove a FHIR resource'
openapi: 'DELETE /{resourceType}/{id}'
---

Marks a resource as deleted. Most servers use soft delete, preserving the resource in history.

## Endpoint

```
DELETE /fhir/{resourceType}/{id}
```

<ParamField path="resourceType" type="string" required>
  The FHIR resource type (e.g., `Patient`, `Observation`, `Encounter`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The logical ID of the resource to delete
</ParamField>

## Headers

<ParamField header="Prefer" type="string">
  Response style:
  - `return=representation` - Return OperationOutcome
  - `return=minimal` (default) - No response body
  - `return=OperationOutcome` - Return OperationOutcome
</ParamField>

## Query Parameters

<ParamField query="search parameters" type="string">
  For conditional delete. Delete the resource matching these search parameters.
  
  Example: `?identifier=http://hospital.example/mrn|12345`
</ParamField>

## Response

### 204 No Content

Resource deleted successfully. No response body.

<ResponseExample>

Headers:

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
ETag: W/"6"
```

</ResponseExample>

### 200 OK

Resource deleted successfully with OperationOutcome (when using `Prefer: return=OperationOutcome`).

<ResponseExample>

```json Deletion Confirmed
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "information",
      "code": "informational",
      "diagnostics": "Resource Patient/123 deleted successfully"
    }
  ]
}
```

Headers:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/fhir+json
ETag: W/"6"
```

</ResponseExample>

### 404 Not Found

Resource doesn't exist (some servers return 204 for idempotency).

<ResponseExample>

```json Not Found
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": "not-found",
      "diagnostics": "Resource Patient/123 not found"
    }
  ]
}
```

</ResponseExample>

### 409 Conflict

Resource cannot be deleted due to referential integrity or business rules.

<ResponseExample>

```json Cannot Delete - Has References
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": "conflict",
      "diagnostics": "Cannot delete Patient/123: referenced by Observation/456, Encounter/789"
    }
  ]
}
```

</ResponseExample>

### 412 Precondition Failed

Conditional delete matched multiple resources (ambiguous).

<ResponseExample>

```json Multiple Matches
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": "multiple-matches",
      "diagnostics": "Multiple resources match search criteria. Conditional delete requires exactly one match."
    }
  ]
}
```

</ResponseExample>

## Examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL - Basic Delete
curl -X DELETE "https://your-server.com/fhir/Patient/123"
```

```bash cURL - Delete with OperationOutcome
curl -X DELETE "https://your-server.com/fhir/Patient/123" \
  -H "Prefer: return=OperationOutcome"
```

```bash cURL - Conditional Delete
curl -X DELETE "https://your-server.com/fhir/Patient?identifier=http://hospital.example/mrn|12345"
```

```bash cURL - Verify Deletion
# Delete the resource
curl -X DELETE "https://your-server.com/fhir/Patient/123"

# Try to read it (should return 410 Gone)
curl -i "https://your-server.com/fhir/Patient/123"
```

```python Python Example
import requests

url = "https://your-server.com/fhir/Patient/123"

response = requests.delete(url)
if response.status_code == 204:
    print("Patient deleted successfully")
elif response.status_code == 404:
    print("Patient not found")
elif response.status_code == 409:
    outcome = response.json()
    print(f"Cannot delete: {outcome['issue'][0]['diagnostics']}")
```

```python Python - With Safety Check
import requests

patient_id = "123"
url = f"https://your-server.com/fhir/Patient/{patient_id}"

# First check if resource exists
response = requests.get(url)
if response.status_code == 200:
    patient = response.json()
    print(f"Deleting patient: {patient['name'][0]['family']}")
    
    # Delete the resource
    response = requests.delete(url)
    if response.status_code == 204:
        print("Deleted successfully")
else:
    print("Patient not found")
```

```javascript JavaScript Example
const url = 'https://your-server.com/fhir/Patient/123';

const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: 'DELETE'
});

if (response.status === 204) {
  console.log('Patient deleted successfully');
} else if (response.status === 404) {
  console.log('Patient not found');
} else if (response.status === 409) {
  const outcome = await response.json();
  console.log(`Cannot delete: ${outcome.issue[0].diagnostics}`);
}
```

```javascript JavaScript - Conditional Delete
const response = await fetch(
  'https://your-server.com/fhir/Patient?identifier=http://hospital.example/mrn|12345',
  {
    method: 'DELETE'
  }
);

if (response.status === 204) {
  console.log('Patient deleted');
} else if (response.status === 412) {
  console.log('Multiple matches found - cannot delete');
}
```

## Delete Behavior

### Soft Delete (Typical)

Most FHIR servers use soft delete:

- Resource marked as deleted in database
- History preserved and accessible
- `GET /Patient/123` returns `410 Gone`
- `GET /Patient/123/_history/5` still works (returns version 5)

### Hard Delete (Rare)

Complete removal from database:

- Resource and all history permanently deleted
- Cannot be recovered
- Usually restricted by policy or disabled entirely

<Note>
**Check Server Behavior**: Review the server's CapabilityStatement or documentation to understand its delete behavior.
</Note>

## Idempotent Delete

DELETE is idempotent - deleting an already-deleted resource succeeds:

```bash
# First delete
DELETE /fhir/Patient/123  # 204 No Content

# Second delete (same resource)
DELETE /fhir/Patient/123  # 204 No Content (idempotent)

# Reading the deleted resource
GET /fhir/Patient/123     # 410 Gone
```

## Conditional Delete

Delete by search criteria instead of ID:

```
DELETE /fhir/{resourceType}?{search_parameters}
```

**Behavior**:
- **0 matches**: No-op, returns `204 No Content`
- **1 match**: Deletes that resource → `204 No Content`
- **2+ matches**: Rejects as ambiguous → `412 Precondition Failed`

**Example**: Delete patient by identifier

```bash
DELETE /fhir/Patient?identifier=http://hospital.example/mrn|12345
```

## Accessing Deleted Resources

After soft delete, use history endpoints to access deleted resources:

```bash
# List all versions (including deleted)
GET /fhir/Patient/123/_history

# Read specific version (even if resource is deleted)
GET /fhir/Patient/123/_history/5
```

## Referential Integrity

Some servers check if other resources reference the resource being deleted:

**Protected Resources** (common scenarios):
- Patient referenced by Observations, Encounters
- Practitioner referenced by many resources
- Organization referenced by locations, departments

**Server Behavior**:
- Allow deletion regardless (most permissive)
- Return `409 Conflict` if references exist (most cautious)
- Cascade delete (rare - delete referencing resources too)

## Common Use Cases

### Delete Test Data

```bash
DELETE /fhir/Patient/test-patient-123
```

### Soft Delete with Verification

```python
import requests

# Delete
requests.delete('https://server.com/fhir/Patient/123')

# Verify it's gone (should get 410)
response = requests.get('https://server.com/fhir/Patient/123')
assert response.status_code == 410, "Resource should be deleted"
```

### Conditional Delete by Identifier

```bash
DELETE /fhir/Patient?identifier=http://hospital.example/temp|temp-12345
```

### Delete with Audit Trail

```python
import requests

patient_id = "123"
url = f"https://server.com/fhir/Patient/{patient_id}"

# Get current state before deleting (for audit)
patient = requests.get(url).json()
audit_log = {
    "action": "delete",
    "resource": patient,
    "timestamp": "2026-01-12T15:00:00Z"
}

# Perform delete
response = requests.delete(url)
if response.status_code == 204:
    print("Deleted and logged")
```

## Best Practices

<Warning>
**Cannot Undo**: Even with soft delete, most UIs don't provide "undelete" functionality. Ensure deletion is intended before proceeding.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Check References First**: Before deleting, search for resources that reference it to avoid breaking referential integrity:

```bash
GET /fhir/Observation?subject=Patient/123
GET /fhir/Encounter?subject=Patient/123
```

If any exist, consider whether deletion is appropriate.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Empty Body**: DELETE requests should have an empty body per FHIR specification. Don't send a resource in the body.
