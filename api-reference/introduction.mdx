## Welcome

The **Zunder** provides a complete RESTful API implementation compliant with the [FHIR R4 specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html). All endpoints are prefixed with `/fhir` and follow FHIR's standard URL patterns.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL. The API playground supports multiple server environments:

- **Local Development**: `http://localhost:8080/fhir` (default port)
- **Production**: Configure your production server URL in the OpenAPI spec

You can switch between servers using the dropdown in the API playground on each endpoint page.

## FHIR Compliance

This server implements the FHIR RESTful API specification, including:

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Patch resources
- **Search**: System-level, type-level, and compartment-based search
- **History**: System, type, and resource-level history with versioning
- **Batch & Transaction**: Batch processing and transaction support
- **Operations**: System, type, and instance-level FHIR operations
- **Metadata**: Capability statement describing server capabilities

## URL Handling

Per FHIR specification:

- **Case Sensitivity**: All URLs and IDs are case-sensitive
  - `/Patient/123` ≠ `/patient/123`
- **Trailing Slashes**: Both forms are supported (with and without trailing slash)
  - `/Patient` and `/Patient/` both work
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: URLs are UTF-8 encoded and decoded automatically
  - `/Patient/abc%20def` → `/Patient/abc def`
  - `/Patient/%E4%B8%AD` → `/Patient/中`

## HTTP Methods

The server supports standard HTTP methods:

- `GET` - Read resources and perform searches
- `POST` - Create resources, batch operations, and search
- `PUT` - Update resources (must include full resource)
- `PATCH` - Partial update of resources
- `DELETE` - Delete resources
- `HEAD` - Check resource existence without body

## Response Formats

The server supports multiple content types:

- `application/fhir+json` (default)
- `application/fhir+xml`
- `application/json`
- `application/xml`

Use the `Accept` header to specify your preferred format, and `Content-Type` header when sending data.

## OpenAPI Specification

A complete OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification is available for this API. You can use it with API clients, testing tools, and documentation generators.

- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Error responses
- Search parameters
- Server configurations for API playground

### API Playground

Each endpoint page includes an interactive API playground where you can:

- Test API calls directly from the documentation
- Switch between different server environments (local, staging, production)
- See request/response examples
- Try different parameters and request bodies

### Using the OpenAPI Spec

You can import this specification into:

- **API Clients**: Postman, Insomnia, HTTPie
