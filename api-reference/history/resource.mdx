      "resource": {

      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "Patient"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## History Entry Structure

Each entry in the history bundle includes:

- `fullUrl` - The versioned URL of the resource
- `resource` - The resource at that version
- `request` - Information about the request that created this version
  - `method` - HTTP method (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
  - `url` - Resource URL

## Filtering by Date

### Since Parameter

Get versions created since a specific date/time:

```bash
GET /fhir/Patient/123/_history?_since=2024-01-01T13:00:00Z
```

### At Parameter

Get the version that existed at a specific point in time:

```bash
GET /fhir/Patient/123/_history?_at=2024-01-01T13:30:00Z
```

## Deleted Resources

If a resource was deleted, the history includes the deletion:

```json
{
  "fullUrl": "https://your-server.com/fhir/Patient/123/_history/4",
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "id": "123",
    "meta": {
      "versionId": "4",
      "lastUpdated": "2024-01-01T15:00:00Z"
    }
  },
  "request": {
    "method": "DELETE",
    "url": "Patient/123"
  }
}
```

## Pagination

Use `_count` and `_offset` for pagination:

```bash
GET /fhir/Patient/123/_history?_count=10&_offset=0
GET /fhir/Patient/123/_history?_count=10&_offset=10
```

The response includes `next` and `previous` links when available.

## Notes

- Resource history shows all versions of a specific resource
- History entries are ordered by version ID (most recent first)
- Deleted resources remain in history
- Use `_since` to get incremental updates for a resource
- The first entry is the original creation (version 1)
