## History Entry Structure

Each entry in the history bundle includes:

- `fullUrl` - The versioned URL of the resource
- `resource` - The resource at that point in time
- `request` - Information about the request that created this version
  - `method` - HTTP method (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
  - `url` - Resource URL

## Filtering by Date

### Since Parameter

Get all changes since a specific date/time:

```bash
GET /fhir/Patient/_history?_since=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z
```

### At Parameter

Get resources as they were at a specific point in time:

```bash
GET /fhir/Patient/_history?_at=2024-01-01T12:00:00Z
```

## Pagination

Use `_count` and `_offset` for pagination:

```bash
GET /fhir/Patient/_history?_count=20&_offset=0
GET /fhir/Patient/_history?_count=20&_offset=20
```

The response includes `next` and `previous` links when available.

## Notes

- Type history shows changes across all instances of the resource type
- History entries are ordered by `lastUpdated` timestamp (most recent first)
- Deleted resources appear in history with their deletion timestamp
- Use `_since` to get incremental updates for a resource type
- The `total` count may be an estimate for performance reasons
