## Versioned Read (vread)

Retrieve a specific version of a resource by its version ID.

<ParamField path="resource_type" type="string" required>
  The FHIR resource type (e.g., `Patient`, `Observation`, `Encounter`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The logical ID of the resource
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="vid" type="string" required>
  The version ID of the resource
</ParamField>

## Endpoint

```
GET /fhir/:resource_type/:id/_history/:vid
```

## Example Request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl "https://your-server.com/fhir/Patient/123/_history/2"
```

```bash HTTP
GET /fhir/Patient/123/_history/2 HTTP/1.1
Host: your-server.com
Accept: application/fhir+json
```

</CodeGroup>

## Response

### Success (200 OK)

Returns the resource at the specified version:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "123",
  "meta": {
    "versionId": "2",
    "lastUpdated": "2024-01-01T13:00:00Z"
  },
  "name": [
    {
      "family": "Doe",
      "given": ["Jane"]
    }
  ],
  "gender": "male",
  "birthDate": "1990-01-01"
}
```

### Not Found (404)

Returns an error if the resource or version doesn't exist:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": "not-found",
      "details": {
        "text": "Resource Patient/123/_history/2 not found"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## HEAD Request

Use `HEAD` to check if a specific version exists without retrieving its body:

```
HEAD /fhir/Patient/123/_history/2
```

Returns `200 OK` if the version exists, `404 Not Found` otherwise. No response body is returned.

## Use Cases

Versioned read is useful for:

- **Audit Trail**: Viewing what a resource looked like at a specific point in time
- **Rollback**: Comparing versions before reverting changes
- **Compliance**: Retrieving historical versions for regulatory requirements
- **Debugging**: Understanding how a resource changed over time

## Getting Version IDs

You can get version IDs from:

1. **Resource metadata**: The `meta.versionId` field in any resource
2. **History endpoint**: The `_history` endpoint lists all versions
3. **ETag header**: The `ETag` header in responses (format: `W/"versionId"`)

## Example Workflow

1. Read current version:
   ```bash
   GET /fhir/Patient/123
   # Returns version 3
   ```

2. Read previous version:
   ```bash
   GET /fhir/Patient/123/_history/2
   # Returns version 2
   ```

3. Compare versions to see what changed

## Notes

- Version IDs are sequential integers starting from 1
- Version 1 is always the original creation
- Deleted resources can still be read by version ID
- Version IDs are immutable - they never change
- Use vread to access historical versions for audit or compliance purposes
