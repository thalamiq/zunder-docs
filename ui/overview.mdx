The Admin UI ships as a separate container (`zunder-ui`) and is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) after following the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart). It connects to the FHIR server through an internal proxy.

## Dashboard

The landing page. Shows resource counts, active/deleted totals, job queue health (last 24h), and recently installed packages. There's also a quick API request input at the top for running GET requests without leaving the page.

## API

An interactive request builder. Type a FHIR endpoint (e.g. `Patient?name=Smith`) and the input autocompletes resource types and search parameters from the server's CapabilityStatement. Results are displayed as formatted JSON or as a table.

## Resources

Lists all resource types on the server with their counts — total, active, and deleted. Includes a bar chart showing the distribution across types. Click any resource type to jump to the API page with that endpoint pre-filled.

## Search

Four sub-pages for inspecting the server's search configuration:

- **Search Parameters** — all indexed search parameters grouped by resource type.
- **Compartments** — compartment definitions (Patient, Encounter) and their membership rules.
- **Search Coverage** — which search parameters are supported vs. defined in the FHIR spec.
- **Index Tables** — the underlying search index tables (token, string, date, number, quantity, uri, reference).

## Packages

Browse and manage installed FHIR packages. You can install packages from public registries (packages.fhir.org, simplifier.net) and view the resources each package provides.

## Jobs

Background job monitoring. Shows queue status (healthy/degraded), 24h stats (completed, failed, pending, running), and a list of recent jobs.

## Audit Logs

Request audit trail. Each log entry includes the HTTP method, path, status code, timestamp, and user identity (if authentication is enabled).

## Metadata

A rendered view of the server's CapabilityStatement — the full list of supported resource types, search parameters, operations, and interaction capabilities.

## Settings

Runtime server configuration. Changes made here are written to the database and take effect immediately without a restart. See [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration) for the full list of settings.
